# Sprint 1
1. At the first of Sprint, my communication with my team members was very smooth, and we are all very happy to be in a team. 
I talked a lot about each other. Everyone feels particularly energetic, we get hundred of power, hundred of motivation to waiting to do something big.
2. If I want to say that there is something I can improve or say to be more perfect, it is that we did not realize the communication with the customer at the beginning. Since I have not yet read the agile manifesto and principal deeply, it is only halfway through the first Sprint that we not only have to communicate well with each other but also communicate with our customer Paul more importantly. So the problem is that we didn't meet the customer for the first time and extract his ideas.
3. At this stage, I learned the basics of the Laravel framework and reviewed the use of GitHub. I just finished web 2 PHP paper last semester, but I don't know anything about the Laravel framework. Fortunately, I have a little understanding of the MVC pattern, so when Martin instills the MVC concept on the whiteboard, I was relieved because I probably know what Laravel is all about, and this week I learned about Laravel's basic additions, deletions, and changes, how to create models, controllers, and views, and let them work. In addition, we have learned how to use GitHub in professional practice paper, and we are constantly using it in the after one year. But that is the most basic. Now we need to understand more deeply, such as the use of branches, the resolution of conflicts, and the focus on the process of multi-person team collaboration development. 
Elise said, try not to delete anything, including branches, commit records, etc., as far as possible, we solve the problem directly, leaving all the final records. I think this is also a good way to make sure that we have really learned this skill so that we can use and collaborate correctly in the workgroup in the future. What's interesting is that I made the first commit in the GitHub class and the Elise sent me a lovely card. This is a happy thing...
4. For me, the first barrier is the difference in philosophy in the first Sprint. I have had a couple of years of development experience, probably a decade ago, so I may have some traditional development methods living in my brain such as waterfall development. When Rob first told us about the project topic and basic needs, what I thought in my mind was the whole prototype of the project. I built a structure of Inventory tracker in my subconscious, and I hope to implement it in the first Sprint. 
Another reason why there may be more functions is that we don't listen to customers' ideas, so I may think a little more. 
But when I was talking to my team members, especially Jorden, in particular, made different ideas. 
That's the module that we only complete a small number of independent functions at each Sprint. We don't make goals that we can't accomplish. This is called Agile development. After my careful consideration, in addition to the above reasons, I think my poor English skills are also a barrier placed in front of me.


# Sprint 2
1. In the second Sprint, the best I did was to communicate with the customer. This time, I learned the bad experience I did last time. At the beginning of the Sprint, I met with the client Paul. I first summarized the work of the previous Sprint and proposed our next goal. Paul also pointed to the above. Both of the above aspects have been asked and verified. To ensure that our customers and our team have a unified goal, we are working hard to achieve the goal within a specified time, without making a mistake. I personally think this time is perfect communication.
2. I think what I can improve is that Laravel is not deep enough to learn, and there are some problems that are not thorough enough. Maybe it is because time is not particularly much. For example, when I was deploying, there was an error (I wrote it in Sprint 2 Golas) because "The base table or view already exists: 1050 Table Trackings already exists". And I just found a solution on the google, that is to delete the table directly, and then continue to deploy. The cost paid is that I lost the data I tested at the beginning. So for us at this stage, there is no problem. Because we don't have any valuable data at the moment.  But if not?  Then this method is not feasible. As Martin said, my xxx is sick, and my solution is to buy a new xxx directly, instead of trying to cure xxx. The problem is that Laravel does have a cure for this disease. Therefore, I feel that the next time I encounter a similar problem, I must thoroughly study the problem and solve the problem fundamentally.
3. At this Sprint, I learned the Scrum and GitHub Agile workflows, learned more about using the Kanban feature, and all user story avatars were assigned to each of our team members. Then we will change our state through our work to know that the final completion is complete and then the work is finished. At the same time, because we have completed some basic functions in the first phase, we also learned how to deploy our current work to our public server. The main purpose of this is to let our customers see it in real time. Go to our results at each Sprint and make comments and suggestions as well as the task requirements they need to modify. Technically, deployment is not that difficult, because almost everyone has completed Linux and MariaDB learning.
