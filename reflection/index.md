write a reflection after each sprint that examines your personal contribution to that sprint.
* What did you do well?
* What could you have done better?
* What lessons did you learn?
* What barriers did you encounter?
Your portfolio must include regular reflection on your contribution to the management of the project, including your personal application of appropriate methodologies, workflows or tools, and identification of ways to improve ethical or professional conduct, during the course of each sprint.

# Sprint 1
1. At the first of Sprint, my communication with my team members was very smooth, and we are all very happy to be in a team. 
I talked a lot about each other. Everyone feels particularly energetic, we get hundred of power, hundred of motivation to waiting to do something big.
2. If I want to say that there is something I can improve or say to be more perfect, it is that we did not realize the communication with the customer at the beginning. Since I have not yet read the agile manifesto and principal deeply, it is only halfway through the first Sprint that we not only have to communicate well with each other but also communicate with our customer Paul more importantly. So the problem is that we didn't meet the customer for the first time and extract his ideas.

4. For me, the first barrier is the difference in philosophy in the first Sprint. I have had a couple of years of development experience, probably a decade ago, so I may have some traditional development methods living in my brain such as waterfall development. When Rob first told us about the project topic and basic needs, what I thought in my mind was the whole prototype of the project. I built a structure of Inventory tracker in my subconscious, and I hope to implement it in the first Sprint. 
Another reason why there may be more functions is that we don't listen to customers' ideas, so I may think a little more. 
But when I was talking to my team members, especially Jorden, in particular, made different ideas. 
That's the module that we only complete a small number of independent functions at each Sprint. We don't make goals that we can't accomplish. This is called Agile development. After my careful consideration, in addition to the above reasons, I think my poor English skills are also a barrier placed in front of me.
