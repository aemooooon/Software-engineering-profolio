write a reflection after each sprint that examines your personal contribution to that sprint.
* What did you do well?
* What could you have done better?
* What lessons did you learn?
* What barriers did you encounter?
Your portfolio must include regular reflection on your contribution to the management of the project, including your personal application of appropriate methodologies, workflows or tools, and identification of ways to improve ethical or professional conduct, during the course of each sprint.
