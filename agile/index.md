Create a section of your portfolio in which you outline the impact of Agile manifesto, principles and tools on the professionalism, ethics and success of your project.
Include specific examples from the project work you have done.
Your portfolio must outline the impact of the Agile methodology on the project, including examples of the application of agile principles, Scrum framework or other tools to manage the project’s ability to meet the users’ needs in a professional and ethical way.

# Agile Manifesto
**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools<br>
**个体和互动** 高于 流程和工具<br>
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation<br>
**工作的软件** 高于 详尽的文档<br>
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation<br>
**客户合作** 高于 合同谈判<br>
**Responding to change** over following a plan<br>
**响应变化** 高于 遵循计划<br>

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
也就是说，尽管右项有其价值，我们更重视左项的价值。

# Agile Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.

# Agile Sprint Velocity
Velocity is a metric that predicts how much work an Agile software development team can successfully complete within a two-week sprint (or similar time-boxed period).

Velocity is a useful planning tool for estimating how fast work can be completed and how long it will take to complete a project. The metric is calculated by reviewing work the team successfully completed during previous sprints; for example, if the team completed 10 stories during a two-week sprint and each story was worth 3 story points, then the team's velocity is 30 story points per sprint. 

Generally, velocity remains somewhat constant during a development project, which makes it a useful metric for estimating how long it will take a team to complete a software development project. If the product backlog has 300 story points, and the team is averaging 30 story points per sprint, it can be estimated that team members will require 10 more sprints to complete work. If each sprint lasts two weeks, then the project will last 20 more weeks. If a team member is moved to another project, however, or new members are added -- the velocity must be recalculated.

# Burndown Chart
Progress on a Scrum project can be tracked by means of a release burndown chart. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the sprints; the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining at the start of each sprint. Work remaining can be shown in whatever unit the team prefers—story points, ideal days, team days and so on.
