# Agile Manifesto
> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:<br>
我们一直在实践中探寻更好的软件开发方法，
身体力行的同时也帮助他人。由此我们建立了如下价值观：<br><br>
**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools<br>
**个体和互动** 高于 流程和工具<br>
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation<br>
**工作的软件** 高于 详尽的文档<br>
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation<br>
**客户合作** 高于 合同谈判<br>
**Responding to change** over following a plan<br>
**响应变化** 高于 遵循计划<br>
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>
也就是说，尽管右项有其价值，我们更重视左项的价值。


# Agile Principles
>1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
我们最重要的目标，是通过持续不断地
及早交付有价值的软件使客户满意。
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.
欣然面对需求变化，即使在开发后期也一样。
为了客户的竞争优势，敏捷过程掌控变化。
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.
经常地交付可工作的软件，
相隔几星期或一两个月，倾向于采取较短的周期。
4. Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.<br>
业务人员和开发人员必须相互合作，
项目中的每一天都不例外。
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.<br>
激发个体的斗志，以他们为核心搭建项目。
提供所需的环境和支援，辅以信任，从而达成目标。
6. The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.<br>
不论团队内外，传递信息效果最好效率也最高的方式是
面对面的交谈。
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.<br>
可工作的软件是进度的首要度量标准。
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.<br>
敏捷过程倡导可持续开发。
责任人、开发人员和用户要能够共同维持其步调稳定延续。
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.<br>
坚持不懈地追求技术卓越和良好设计，敏捷能力由此增强。
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.<br>
以简洁为本，它是极力减少不必要工作量的艺术。
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
最好的架构、需求和设计出自自组织团队。
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.<br>
团队定期地反思如何能提高成效，
并依此调整自身的举止表现。


I put the Agile Manifesto and Agile Principles reason here, just to see it every time when I am working on this page, to be more familiar with the understanding and mastering of Agile. 

When I first listened to Martin talk about Agile in class, I simply thought that Agile was just a sort of popular method of software development. But as I continude to learn and practice, and in the process of working with my team member, I found that Agile is not only a software development method. It is a collection of methodology that combine many theories and declarations. It is a value that allows software developers to implement these values in different ways from different aspect, in order to make software development faster and more efficient.

If literally translate Agile to Chinese is "敏捷", which means (action)quick and sensitive, so literally we can see some clues. 

First of all, the number one of Agile manifesto stated that Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, which means compared with tools and processes, people are the core factor. The value of people and people directly interacting with each other is higher than the value of tools and processes. I think the software development industry is different from the traditional factory manufacturing industry. They emphasize tools and processes because they generate fixd stuff, do not need people creativity, and no frequent changes in demand. The software development needs change rapidly, and if you don't keep up with the customer's needs in time, it will waste the developer's time and cost. Therefore, we can communicate with customers in a timely manner, and quickly display short-item displayable products to customers to create value efficiently.

I won't write my understanding of all the Agile Manifesto here. I think these manifesto are relative to the traditional waterfall development method, but in our team, I believe most of us don't know too much about the waterfall Development model, although I have had some years of waterfall development experience. 

I believe that the behavior of our group is as close as possible to the Agile Manifesto from the beginning of the project. For instance, Our team has been keeping in a timely and effective communication with our customer Paul. In addition to not doing well before the start of the project, we communicate with our client Paul at least twice a week. At the same time, in the use of tools, everyone can choose the development tools according to their own strengths, and the project management tools we use github unified.


# Agile Sprint Velocity
Velocity is a metric that predicts how much work an Agile software development team can successfully complete within a two-week sprint (or similar time-boxed period).

Velocity is a useful planning tool for estimating how fast work can be completed and how long it will take to complete a project. The metric is calculated by reviewing work the team successfully completed during previous sprints; for example, if the team completed 10 stories during a two-week sprint and each story was worth 3 story points, then the team's velocity is 30 story points per sprint. 

Generally, velocity remains somewhat constant during a development project, which makes it a useful metric for estimating how long it will take a team to complete a software development project. If the product backlog has 300 story points, and the team is averaging 30 story points per sprint, it can be estimated that team members will require 10 more sprints to complete work. If each sprint lasts two weeks, then the project will last 20 more weeks. If a team member is moved to another project, however, or new members are added -- the velocity must be recalculated.

# Burndown Chart
Progress on a Scrum project can be tracked by means of a release burndown chart. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the sprints; the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining at the start of each sprint. Work remaining can be shown in whatever unit the team prefers—story points, ideal days, team days and so on.
