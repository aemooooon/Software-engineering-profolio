Sprint goals: for each sprint, set one SMART goal to cover each of:
* professional practices (e.g. teamwork, client communication, ethical considerations),
* technical proficiency (e.g. framework challenges, ops challenges, source code control),
* Agile-ness (e.g. user stories, sprint management, scrum master).
At the end of the sprint, provide evidence that you have met each goal. Warning! Do not set goals you canâ€™t achieve!
Your portfolio will need to demonstrate sufficient commitment to making appropriate professional, technical and methodological contributions to the project via evidence of achieving specific, measurable, appropriate, relevant and time-bound goals for each sprint (i.e. SMART goals)
