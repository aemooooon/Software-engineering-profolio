title: Sprint Goals
description: For each sprint, set one SMART goal to cover each of: professional practices (e.g. teamwork, client communication, ethical considerations), technical proficiency (e.g. framework challenges, ops challenges, source code control), Agile-ness (e.g. user stories, sprint management, scrum master). At the end of the sprint, provide evidence that you have met each goal. Warning! Do not set goals you canâ€™t achieve!
